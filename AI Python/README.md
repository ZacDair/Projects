DotMoveToGoalAI.py is AI learning to go from it's starting point, to a goal.
It uses the grpahics.py file to display the AI moving, this file was not created by me.
The AI learns by the best in the previous generation being cloned,
and each AI in the new generation uses it's memories but at each descision it has a chance to mutate
mutations are used to perform better or worse that the best of the last generation, until it performs as efficently as possible.

WordGuessingAI.py is AI learning a string, it uses the same generational system as above, and mutates in order to guess what the string is

graphics.py is a file used to display the AI movement in the DotMoveToGoal
