Script that uses the current working directory (the directory the script is placed in)
And edits every python file (ending in .py) and adds a comment at the start including:  
The title of the file  
The Author (by default me)  
The Date the file was created  

Future plans for this:  
Add multi language support  
Allow users to run the script with attributes (path to edit, their own name)  
Fix minimum 3 line bug (temporarily fixed with a try and except)
